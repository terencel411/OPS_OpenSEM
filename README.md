### OPS_OpenSEM

OPS version of methods implemented in https://github.com/chhc-1/OpenSEM .

oSEM, MRSEM, ISEM have been implemented. Note the version of ISEM in https://github.com/chhc-1/OpenSEM is currently bugged - it should not produce the correct Reynold's Stress Tensor.

These scripts have been tested using the OPS-DSL library [1] and HDF5-1.14.6.

The methods in this repository have been tested using the OpenSBLI CFD code [2], and the code for those simulations are in the 'OpenSBLI_cases' folder.
